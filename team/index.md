## <i class="fas fa-feather-alt"></i>Collaborating Lab
We collaborate closely with **Prof. Zhong Yuyue** and his team,  whose research focuses on leveraging starch to enhance food nutritional value, prevent obesity and diabetes, and develop advanced starch-based materials. Their innovative work complements our own and fosters a productive exchange of ideas.
